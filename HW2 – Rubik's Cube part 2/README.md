My part 2 implementation of the Rubik's Cube as directed in the [instructions file](https://github.com/IustinToader9/CS380-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/98996be1d8dbecd382d99f21aa251262d9272b12/HW2%20%E2%80%93%20Rubik's%20Cube%20part%202/RC%20Part%202.pdf)

This version extends on the previous one by searching for Rubik's Cube solutions using: Breadth-First Search, Depth Limited Search, Iterative Deepening Search, and A* Search with the sum of Manhattan distance for all 8 corners divided by 4 as the heuristic.
